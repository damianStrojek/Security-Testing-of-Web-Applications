# Security Testing Environment for Web Applications

## Description

The aim of the project is to create an environment that will allow conducting experiments on the security of web applications by emulating popular types of their vulnerabilities and interacting with them in a controlled manner. 

The environment allows for the implementation of various methods of attack, defense and detection of vulnerabilities. The created product is to be characterized by an extensible architecture, allowing for the addition of new modules enabling the emulation of new vulnerabilities and the use of new detection, attack and defense tools.

## Local Deployment

To deploy the environment locally you need to `clone` this repository and host it using one of many ways.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damianStrojek/Security-Testing-of-Web-Applications.git
```

```python
# Hosting HTTP server on port 80
python3 -m http.server 80
```
