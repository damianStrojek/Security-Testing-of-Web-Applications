      <b>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</b> is a vulnerability that lets an attacker control some of the content of a web application. 
      A vulnerable web app is what makes XSS attack possible. XSS vulnerabilities happen when a web app uses unfiltered user 
      input to build the output content displayed to its end users. This lets an attacker cotrol the output HTML and JS code, 
      thus attacking the application users. XSS involves injecting malicious code into the output of a web page. This 
      malicious code is then rendered (or executed) by the browser of the visiting users.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find an XSS you have to look at every user input, and test if it is somehow displayed on the output of the web application. 
      After finding a reflection point, you have to understand if you can inject HTML code and see if it somehow gets to the output 
      of the page; this lets you control the output page!
      <br>
      To exploit an XSS vulnerability that you find, you need to know the type of cross-site scripting attack you are carrying out. 
      XSS vulnerabilities can be reflected, persistent or DOM Based.
      <br>
      - <b>Reflected attacks</b> happen when the malicious payload is carried inside the request that the browser of the victim sends 
      to the vulnerable website. They could be triggered by posting a link on a social network or via a phishing campaign.
      <br>
      Some browsers have a reflected XSS filter built in but they can only filter trivial and known XSS attacks. There are advanced 
      attacks that can bypass Anti-XSS filters. Reflected XSS vulnerabilities can often occur in search fields and results, as well 
      as anywhere user input is included in error messages.
      <br>
      - <b>Stored (Persistent) XSS</b> attacks occur when the payload is sent to the vulnerable web server and then stored. When a 
      web page of the vulnerable website pulls the stored malicious code and puts it within the HTML output, it will deliver the XSS 
      payload. It is called persistent because the malicious code gets delivered each time a web browser hits the "injected" web page.
      <br>
      The web application then retrieves this payload and displays it to anyone who visits a vulnerable page. A single Stored XSS 
      vulnerability can therefore attack all site users. Stored XSS vulnerabilities often exist in forum software, especially in 
      comment sections, in product reviews, or wherever user content can be stored and reviewed later.
      <br>
      - <b>DOM-based XSS</b> takes place solely within the page's Document Object Model (DOM). While we won't cover too much detail 
      for now, we should know that browsers parse a page's HTML content and then generate an internal DOM representation. This type 
      of XSS occurs when a page's DOM is modified with user-controlled values. DOM-based XSS can be stored or reflected; the key is 
      that DOM-based XSS attacks occur when a browser parses the page's content and inserted JavaScript is executed.
    </p>

<!-- Second Section: Basic Example of XSS Attack -->
<section id="basic-example" class="section scrollspy">
  <h3 class="page-title white-text teal">Basic Example</h3>
  <div class="container flow-text">     
    <p>
      Let's demonstrate basic XSS with a simple attack against the OffSec WordPress instance. The WordPress installation is running a 
      plugin named Visitors that is vulnerable to stored XSS.1 The plugin's main feature is to log the website's visitor data, 
      including the IP, source, and User-Agent fields.
      <br>
      The source code for the plugin can be downloaded from its <a href="https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/visitors-app.0.3.zip" target="_blank">
      website</a>. If we inspect the database.php file, we can verify how the data is stored inside the WordPress database:
      <div>
        <img src="assets/img/xss-basic-example-1.png" class="img-modules" alt="xss example">
      </div>
      This PHP function is responsible for parsing various HTTP request headers, including the User-Agent, which is saved in 
      the useragent record value.
      <br>
      Next, each time a WordPress administrator loads the Visitor plugin, the function will execute the following portion of 
      code from start.php:
      <div>
        <img src="assets/img/xss-basic-example-2.png" class="img-modules" alt="xss example">
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      From the above code, we'll notice that the useragent record value is retrieved from the database and inserted plainly in 
      the Table Data (td) HTML tag, without any sort of data sanitization.
      <br>
      As the User-Agent header is under user control, we could craft an XSS attack by inserting a script tag invoking the alert() 
      method to generate a pop-up message. Given the immediate visual impact, this method is very commonly used to verify that an 
      application is vulnerable to XSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Burp configured as a proxy and Intercept disabled, we can start our attack by first browsing to http://offsecwp/ 
      using Firefox.
      <br>
      We'll then go to Burp Proxy > HTTP History, right-click on the request, and select Send to Repeater.
      <div>
        <img src="assets/img/xss-basic-example-3.png" class="img-modules" alt="xss example">
      </div>
      Moving to the Repeater tab, we can replace the default User-Agent value with the a script tag that includes the alert method, 
      then send the request.
      <div>
        <img src="assets/img/xss-basic-example-4.png" class="img-modules" alt="xss example">
      </div>
      If the server responds with a 200 OK message, we should be confident that our payload is now stored in the WordPress database.
      <br>
      To verify this, let's log in to the admin console at http://offsecwp/wp-login.php using the admin/password credentials.
      <br>
      If we navigate to the Visitors plugin console at http://offsecwp/wp-admin/admin.php?page=visitors-app%2Fadmin%2Fstart.php, we 
      are greeted with a pop-up banner showing the number 42, proving that our code injection worked.
      <div>
        <img src="assets/img/xss-basic-example-5.png" class="img-modules" alt="xss example">
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Excellent. We have injected an XSS payload into the web application's database and it will be served to any administrator that 
      loads the plugin. A simple alert window is a somewhat trivial example of what can be done with XSS, so let's try something more 
      interesting, like creating a new administrative account.
