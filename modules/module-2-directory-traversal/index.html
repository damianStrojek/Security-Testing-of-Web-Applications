  <div class="container flow-text">     
    <p>
      Properly controlling access to web content is crucial for running a secure web server. <b>Directory traversal or Path Traversal</b> 
      is an HTTP attack that allows attackers to access restricted directories and execute commands outside of the web server's root directory.
      <div>
        <img src="assets/img/directory-traversal-example-1.svg" class="img-modules" alt="hydra example">
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      This type of attack is commonly performed using web browsers. Any server that fails to validate input data from web browsers is 
      vulnerable to a directory traversal attack.
      <br>
      Directory traversal is also known as <cde>directory climbing, backtracking and file path traversal</cde> vulnerabilities. Directory 
      traversal is similar to Structured Query Language injection and cross-site scripting in that they all involve code injection.
    </p>
    <p>
      IT security professionals minimize the risk of a directory traversal with the following techniques:<br>
      - careful web server programming;<br>
      - installation of software updates and patches;<br>
      - filtering of input from browsers;<br>
      - using vulnerability scanners.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Second Section: How to check -->
<section id="how-to" class="section scrollspy">
  <h3 class="page-title white-text teal">How-To check for directory traversal</h3>
  <div class="container flow-text">     
    <p>
      Here are two ways to manually check for directory traversal vulnerabilities:<br>
      1. <b>Input vector enumeration</b> - Enumeration tells the tester which parts of a web application could be vulnerable to attempts 
      to bypass input validation. The tester identifies parts of an application that accept user input, including POST and GET calls, file 
      uploads and Hypertext Markup Language forms.<br>
      2. <b>Common patterns</b> - Security pros can look for common patterns in the application's URL structure to identify directory 
      traversal vulnerabilities. If an application uses a querystring parameter to specify the file path, an attacker may be able to 
      manipulate this parameter to access files outside of the intended path. Search engines can also be used to find URLs that are 
      likely to have file names included in them.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Third section: Tools -->
<section id="tools" class="section scrollspy">
  <h3 class="page-title white-text teal">Tools</h3>
  <div class="container flow-text">     
    <p>
      <b>Gobuster</b> is one of the most powerful and speed brute-force tools that doesn't need a runtime. It uses a directory scanner programmed 
      by Go language; it's faster and more flexible than interpreted script.
      <br>
      If you look at the help command, we can see that Gobuster has a few modes: dir — Directory enumeration mode, dns — Subdomain enumeration 
      mode, fuzz — Fuzzing mode, s3 — S3 enumeration mode, vhost — Vhost enumeration mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gobuster's directory mode (<b>dir</b>) helps us to look for hidden files and URL paths. This can include images, script files, and almost 
      any file that is exposed to the internet.
      <pre>
        <code> $ gobuster dir -u [url] -w [wordlist] </code>
      </pre>
      Now let's try the dir mode. Here is the command to look for URLs with the common wordlist.
      <pre>
        <code> $ gobuster dir -u 10.10.171.247:80 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt </code>
      </pre>
      And here is the result. We can see that there are some exposed files that we should take a closer look at.
      <div>
        <img src="./assets/img/gobuster-example-1.png" class="img-modules" alt="gobuster example">

  </div>
  <div class="container flow-text">     
    <p>
      <b>dirbuster</b> is a multi threaded java application designed to brute force directories and files names on web/application servers. 
      Often is the case now of what looks like a web server in a state of default installation is actually not, and has pages and applications hidden within. 
      DirBuster attempts to find these.<br>
      However tools of this nature are often as only good as the directory and file list they come with. A different approach was taken to generating this. 
      The list was generated from scratch, by crawling the Internet and collecting the directory and files that are actually used by developers! DirBuster comes a total of 9 different lists, 
      this makes DirBuster extremely effective at finding those hidden files and directories. And if that was not enough DirBuster also has the option to perform a pure brute force, which 
      leaves the hidden directories and files nowhere to hide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, dirbuster has the recursive search option enabled by default which helps with searching deeper than root directory of web service.

<!-- Fourth Section: Examples -->
<section id="examples" class="section scrollspy">
  <h3 class="page-title white-text teal">Examples of directory traversal vulnerability</h3>
  <div class="container flow-text">     
    <p>
      Consider a shopping application that displays images of items for sale. Images are loaded via some HTML like the following:
      <pre>
        <code> img src="/loadImage?filename=218.png" </code>
      </pre>
      The loadImage URL takes a filename parameter and returns the contents of the specified file. The image files themselves are 
      stored on disk in the location <cde>/var/www/images/</cde>. To return an image, the application appends the requested filename 
      to this base directory and uses a filesystem API to read the contents of the file. In the above case, the application reads 
      from the following file path: <cde>/var/www/images/218.png</cde>
      <br>
      The application implements no defenses against directory traversal attacks, so an attacker can request the following URL to 
      retrieve an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem:
      <pre>
        <code> https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd </code>
      </pre>
      This causes the application to read from the following file path: <cde>/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd</cde>
      <br>
      The sequence <cde>../</cde> is valid within a file path, and means to step up one level in the directory structure. The three 
      consecutive <cde>../</cde> sequences step up from <cde>/var/www/images/</cde> to the filesystem root, and so the file that is actually 
      read is: <cde>/etc/passwd</cde>
    </p>
    <p>
      Many applications that place user input into file paths implement some kind of defense against path traversal attacks, and 
      these can often be circumvented.
      <br>
      If an application strips or blocks directory traversal sequences from the user-supplied filename, then it might be possible 
      to bypass the defense using a variety of techniques.
      <br>
      1. You might be able to use an absolute path from the filesystem root, such as <cde>filename=/etc/passwd</cde>, to directly reference 
      a file without using any traversal sequences.
      <br>
      2. You might be able to use nested traversal sequences, such as <cde>....//</cde> or <cde>....\/</cde>, which will revert to simple 
      traversal sequences when the inner sequence is stripped.
      <br>
      3. In some contexts, such as in a URL path or the <cde>filename</cde> parameter of a multipart/form-data request, web servers may strip 
      any directory traversal sequences before passing your input to the application. You can sometimes bypass this kind of sanitization by 
      URL encoding, or even double URL encoding, the <cde>../</cde> characters, resulting in <cde>%2e%2e%2f</cde> or <cde>%252e%252e%252f</cde> 
      respectively. Various non-standard encodings, such as <cde>..%c0%af</cde> or <cde>..%ef%bc%8f</cde>, may also do the trick. For Burp 
      Suite Professional users, Burp Intruder provides a predefined payload list (Fuzzing - path traversal), which contains a variety of 
      encoded path traversal sequences that you can try.
      <br>
      4. If an application requires that the user-supplied filename must start with the expected base folder, such as <cde>/var/www/images</cde>, 
      then it might be possible to include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences. For example:
      <pre>
        <code> filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd </code>
      </pre>
    </p>
